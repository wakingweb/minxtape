Mix Tapes.  Remixed.

## Introduction

This is a project inspired by the old [Muxtape](http://muxtape.tumblr.com/) project. I loved it's simplicity, and I found myself missing a way to share music compilations with other people. Especially for those few tracks that aren't on streaming services.

## Features

* mp3/ogg file upload
* drag-and-drop re-ordering of tracks
* add album art
* facebook authentication

## Plans

Here are some high priority improvements I'm working on:

* Show only one audio element at a time
* Fix auto-play next track on mobile browsers
* Global volume control, hide volume from html5 audio controls
* Auto-fill "Song - Artists" from  uploaded file metadata

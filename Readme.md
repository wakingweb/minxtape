Mix Tapes.  Remixed.

## Introduction

This is a project inspired by the old [Muxtape](http://muxtape.tumblr.com/) project. I loved it's simplicity, and I found myself missing a way to share music compilations with other people. Especially for those few tracks that aren't on streaming services.

## Features

* mp3/ogg file upload
* drag-and-drop re-ordering of tracks
* add album art
* facebook authentication

## Plans

Here are some high priority improvements I'm working on:

* Global play/pause/volume control, hide html5 audio components
* Skip to track by clicking on track name
* Auto-fill "Song - Artists" from  uploaded file metadata
* Add username to user profiles
* Show who each mix was created by
* Add "My Mixes" page only showing current_user mixes
